# VoiceRecognition
A simple project that works as a proof of concepts using Arduino Leonardo, [321 Maker Shield](https://github.com/321maker) and the [Speech Recognition Library](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition).

#Implemented Commands
-Calculator Mode
	*When the device recognizes the command "calculator mode" it tunrs into a simple calculator and asks you for 3 inputs: the first number, the operation and the second number.

-Temperature Mode
	*When the command "temperature" is heard, the device shows the current temperature measured.

-Humidity Mode
	*Triggered by the command "humidity", the device measures and shows the current humidity.

-Easter Eggs
	*"Play me a song" command.
	*"Who's the best teacher" command. (NOTE, I'm sorry if you're a teacher and the board doesn't show your name, the name found on the code has its reasons to be there.
